* This is a demo of code texting
* I looked through many awsome websites since I was graduated

## Task Log
* Recently , I found a coding practicing website .
* The website contains many tasks , which improve our Algorith designing .
* There was a task named My Calender III , when I first saw it , I was confused .
* I thought it was about checking how many programs can be running in a time quantum.
* Too naive , right?
* Now I know .
* First , get an empty container (new a timeline , no program running during this , only one program can run in a timeline). 
* Second , for instance , there is requiring a programOne(10,30) running from 10s to 30s .
* Third , Put this program into the timeline .
* Then require another programTwo(20,40)
* ProgramOne and ProgramTwo are conflicted in (20,30) .
* Then new a timelineTwo , put programTwo into timelineTwo.
* The answer They required is the count of timelines.
